# Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project demonstrates the process of building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab.

## Project Steps

1. **Import Libraries and Dataset**
2. **Visualize the Dataset**
3. **Build the CNN Model**
4. **Compile and Train the Model**
5. **Evaluate the Model**
6. **Fine-tune the Model**

## Installation

Google Colab typically comes with TensorFlow pre-installed. If you are running this on a local machine, you might need to install TensorFlow.

```bash
pip install tensorflow
